# Running TRINITY

## Running a simulation

A TRINITY run is fully specified by one plain-text parameter file, and
there is a single command — from the repository root:

```bash
python run.py param/simple_cluster.param
```

The path may be absolute or relative to the repository root. `run.py`
scans the file and dispatches automatically: if the file contains list
(`[...]`) or `tuple(...)` syntax it runs a parameter sweep across a
parallel worker pool, otherwise it runs a single simulation. There is no
separate command or flag for sweeps.

Output is written to the directory named by the `path2output` parameter;
the sentinel `def_dir` (the default) means the current working
directory. See *Outputs* below for the file layout.

## Parameter-file formats

A parameter file lists one `keyword    value` entry per line (see the
Parameters reference for the full keyword list). The *value* syntax
alone decides whether the file is a single run or a sweep:

**`param/sweep_hybrid_example.param`**

```text
# Plain key/value — fixed across every run
dens_profile    densPL
nISM            0.1
path2output     outputs/demo

# tuple(...) — only these explicit (mCloud, sfe) pairs are run
tuple(mCloud, sfe)    [1e5, 0.01] [1e7, 0.10]

# [list] — swept Cartesian-style across each tuple pair
nCore    [1e3, 1e4]
```

The file above mixes all three value forms. How many simulations a file
generates depends only on which forms it uses:

| Value syntax | Mode | Runs generated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| no `[ ]`, no `tuple()` | single | 1 |
| `key [a, b, c]` | Cartesian | every combination (e.g. `mCloud` × `sfe` = 3 × 2 = 6) |
| `tuple(x, y) [..] [..]` | tuple | only the listed points, no expansion |
| tuple **and** list together | hybrid | tuple points × list combinations |

The hybrid example therefore runs 2 tuple pairs × 2 `nCore` values = 4
simulations. Single-purpose worked examples ship as
`param/sweep_example.param` (Cartesian),
`param/sweep_tuple_example.param` (tuple), and
`param/sweep_hybrid_example.param` (hybrid).

## Command-line flags

All flags are optional and take effect when the file triggers sweep mode
(they are ignored for single runs):

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run`, `-n` | Preview all combinations (with any GMC warnings) without running. |
| `--workers N`, `-w` | Number of parallel workers. Default `max(1, CPU count // 2 - 1)` — conservative so a laptop stays responsive; raise it on HPC nodes. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the interactive confirmation prompt. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | DEBUG-level logs and the full base-parameter list. |

Before launching, `run.py` runs a GMC-parameter plausibility check
(cloud mass vs. core/ISM density, cloud radius, …) on every combination;
invalid ones are listed up front so you can abort rather than waste
compute. Press `Ctrl+C` — or send `SIGTERM`, e.g. from SLURM `scancel` —
to cancel cleanly: in-flight workers are stopped and a report of
completed / failed / cancelled runs is written to the output directory.

## Outputs

### File layout

A single run writes three files into `path2output`:

```text
path2output/
├── dictionary.jsonl            # simulation state, one JSON object per snapshot
├── {model_name}_summary.txt    # human-readable parameter summary
└── trinity.log                 # log file (written when log_file = True)
```

A sweep writes those same three files into one subdirectory per
combination, plus two top-level reports:

```text
outputs/my_sweep/
├── 1e5_sfe001_n1e3/
│   ├── dictionary.jsonl
│   ├── 1e5_sfe001_n1e3_summary.txt
│   └── trinity.log
├── 1e5_sfe001_n1e4/
│   └── ...
├── sweep_report.txt            # human-readable sweep summary
└── sweep_report.json           # machine-readable sweep summary
```

### Auto-generated run names

Each sweep combination is named automatically:

```text
{mCloud}_sfe{sfe*100:03d}_n{nCore}[_density-profile][_PHII]
```

The optional suffixes appear only when the relevant parameter is set
explicitly in the sweep file (not when left at its `default.param`
value):

- `_PL{alpha}` for `dens_profile = densPL` (e.g. `_PL0`, `_PL-2`), or
  `_BE{Omega}` for `densBE` (e.g. `_BE14`).
- `_yesPHII` / `_noPHII` when `include_PHII` is set — useful when
  sweeping the flag to compare runs with and without HII pressure.

For example, `1e7_sfe010_n1e4_noPHII` is `mCloud=1e7, sfe=0.10,
nCore=1e4` with `include_PHII = False`.

### Snapshot data model

Each simulation writes its full state to `dictionary.jsonl` as a stream
of newline-delimited JSON objects, one per snapshot. Writes are
append-only, so the file remains readable after a crash — the last line
may be partial but every prior line is a complete snapshot.

Snapshot keys group into a handful of categories:

| Category | Example keys |
| --- | --- |
| Administrative | `path2output`, `model_name`, `current_phase`, `SimulationEndReason` |
| Cloud setup | `mCloud`, `sfe`, `mCluster`, `rCloud`, `initial_cloud_r_arr`, `initial_cloud_n_arr`, `initial_cloud_m_arr` |
| Dynamical state | `t_now`, `R2`, `v2`, `Eb`, `T0`, `R1`, `Pb` |
| Feedback (SB99) | `Lmech_W`, `Lmech_SN`, `Qi`, `Lbol`, `pdot` |
| Forces | `F_grav`, `F_ram`, `F_ram_wind`, `F_ram_SN`, `F_ion_out`, `F_HII_St`, `F_rad` |
| Bubble profile | `log_bubble_T_arr` + `bubble_T_arr_r_arr`, `log_bubble_n_arr` + `bubble_n_arr_r_arr`, `bubble_v_arr` + `bubble_v_arr_r_arr` |
| Shell profile | `log_shell_n_arr` + `shell_r_arr`, `shell_grav_force_m` + `shell_grav_r` |

A single snapshot row looks like:

```json
{
  "snap_id": 42,
  "t_now": 1.523e-01,
  "current_phase": "energy",
  "R2": 2.48, "v2": 15.7, "Eb": 9.21e+06, "T0": 7.4e+06,
  "R1": 0.31, "Pb": 3.1e+04,
  "Lmech_W": 1.22e+11, "Lmech_SN": 0.0, "Qi": 4.5e+50, "Lbol": 1.1e+40,
  "F_grav": 9.3e+02, "F_ram": 1.6e+03, "F_rad": 7.2e+02,
  "log_shell_n_arr": [3.1, 3.2, ...], "shell_r_arr":  [2.48, 2.49, ...]
}
```

For analysis, load snapshots through the TRINITY reader, which wraps
`dictionary.jsonl` with a `TrinityOutput` container and exposes
time-series extraction, snapshot interpolation, phase and time-range
filtering, pandas conversion, and batch helpers for sweep outputs. The
in-memory `DescribedDict` and the buffer→flush pipeline that produce the
file are documented under *Snapshot Persistence* in the Architecture
reference.

## Logging

The Parameters reference lists the four logging parameters (`log_level`,
`log_console`, `log_file`, `log_colors`) and their defaults. This
section covers the conceptual ladder of log levels and an example of the
output.

### Log levels

Each level includes itself and all more severe levels:
`CRITICAL > ERROR > WARNING > INFO > DEBUG`. Setting `log_level = INFO`
emits `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages.

| Level | Typical messages | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEBUG` | Variable values, loop iterations, intermediate calculations, function entry/exit. | Development; debugging specific issues (default). |
| `INFO` | Phase transitions, major events (bubble burst, cloud edge reached), initialisation and completion markers. | Normal simulation runs. |
| `WARNING` | Values clamped to limits, fallback behaviour, unusual but non-critical conditions. | Production runs where only potential problems matter. |
| `ERROR` | Calculation failures, recoverable errors. | Silent runs where only actual errors matter. |
| `CRITICAL` | Unrecoverable failures, fatal errors. | When only simulation-stopping errors should print. |

### Example output

With `log_level = INFO`:

```text
2026-01-08 15:30:00 | INFO     | src.main | === TRINITY Simulation Starting ===
2026-01-08 15:30:00 | INFO     | src.main | Model: test_simulation

```

## Troubleshooting

Most parameter errors are typos against the schema; the authoritative
list of valid keywords and defaults is `src/_input/default.param`,
mirrored in the Parameters reference. For issues and feature requests,
