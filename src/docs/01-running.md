# Running TRINITY

## Running a simulation

A TRINITY run is fully specified by one plain-text parameter file, and
there is a single command — from the repository root:

```bash
python run.py param/simple_cluster.param
```

The path may be absolute or relative to the repository root. `run.py`
scans the file and dispatches automatically: if the file contains list
(`[...]`) or `tuple(...)` syntax it runs a parameter sweep across a
parallel worker pool, otherwise it runs a single simulation. There is no
separate command or flag for sweeps. On an HPC cluster you can instead
generate a SLURM job array with `--emit-jobs` (see *Running on a cluster
(SLURM)* below).

Output is written to the directory named by the `path2output` parameter;
the default sentinel `def_dir` resolves to `outputs/<model_name>/` under
the current working directory. See *Outputs* below for the file layout.

## Parameter-file formats

A parameter file lists one `keyword    value` entry per line (see the
[Parameter Specifications](?view=docs&page=parameters) for the full
keyword reference). The *value* syntax alone decides whether the file is
a single run or a sweep:

**`param/sweep_hybrid_example.param`**

```text
# Plain key/value — fixed across every run
dens_profile    densPL
nISM            0.1
path2output     outputs/demo

# tuple(...) — only these explicit (mCloud, sfe) pairs are run
tuple(mCloud, sfe)    [1e5, 0.01] [1e7, 0.10]

# [list] — swept Cartesian-style across each tuple pair
nCore    [1e3, 1e4]
```

The file above mixes all three value forms. How many simulations a file
generates depends only on which forms it uses:

| Value syntax | Mode | Runs generated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| no `[ ]`, no `tuple()` | single | 1 |
| `key [a, b, c]` | Cartesian | every combination (e.g. `mCloud` × `sfe` = 3 × 2 = 6) |
| `tuple(x, y) [..] [..]` | tuple | only the listed points, no expansion |
| tuple **and** list together | hybrid | tuple points × list combinations |

The hybrid example therefore runs 2 tuple pairs × 2 `nCore` values = 4
simulations. Single-purpose worked examples ship as
`param/sweep_example.param` (Cartesian),
`param/sweep_tuple_example.param` (tuple), and
`param/sweep_hybrid_example.param` (hybrid).

## Command-line flags

All flags are optional. Most take effect only in sweep mode; for a
single run, `--dry-run` prints the resolved file and exits without
running, while `--workers` and `--yes` are ignored:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run`, `-n` | Preview all combinations (with any GMC warnings) without running. |
| `--workers N`, `-w` | Parallel workers for the in-process sweep pool — or the array concurrency cap with `--emit-jobs`. Default inside a SLURM job: the full allocation (`SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`, else `SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE` / CPU affinity); on a laptop: `max(1, CPU count // 2 - 1)`. Must be `>= 1`; refused if it exceeds the cores available to this process. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the interactive confirmation prompt. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | DEBUG-level logs and the full base-parameter list. |
| `--emit-jobs DIR` | Generate a SLURM job-array bundle in `DIR` (one task per combination) instead of running locally; requires a sweep file. Mutually exclusive with `--collect-report` (see below). |
| `--collect-report DIR` | Aggregate a finished `--emit-jobs` bundle into `sweep_report.txt` / `.json`; needs no parameter file. |

Before launching, `run.py` runs a GMC-parameter plausibility check
(cloud mass vs. core/ISM density, cloud radius, …) on every combination;
invalid ones are listed up front so you can abort rather than waste
compute. Press `Ctrl+C` — or send `SIGTERM`, e.g. from SLURM `scancel` —
to cancel cleanly: in-flight workers are stopped and a report of
completed / failed / cancelled runs is written to the output directory.

## Running on a cluster (SLURM)

On a laptop or a single multi-core node, a sweep runs across an
in-process worker pool sized by `--workers`. To scale across nodes on an
HPC cluster (e.g. bwForCluster Helix / bwUniCluster), generate a SLURM
**job array** instead — one array task per combination, so the scheduler
packs them across nodes and restarts failures independently:

```bash
python run.py param/sweep_example.param --emit-jobs jobs/
# edit jobs/submit_sweep.sbatch: --account, --partition, --time, --mem
sbatch jobs/submit_sweep.sbatch
python run.py --collect-report jobs/      # after the array finishes
```

Running the in-process pool on a *login* node is discouraged; `run.py`
prints a warning when SLURM is detected without an active job.

`--emit-jobs DIR` writes a self-contained, submittable bundle:

```text
jobs/
├── params/<run_name>.param   # one per combination, absolute path2output
├── runs.tsv                  # param_path <TAB> output_dir; line N = array task N
├── manifest.json             # index: names, params, output dirs
├── submit_sweep.sbatch       # #SBATCH --array=1-N[%K]; one sim per task
└── logs/                     # %A_%a.out per task
```

Each array task runs `python run.py <combo>.param` with one CPU and
math-library threads pinned to one (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` …,
`MPLBACKEND=Agg`); parallelism comes from running many tasks, not from
threading one. Passing `--workers K` at emit time caps concurrency as
`--array=1-N%K`.

When the array finishes, `--collect-report DIR` reads each task's
`.exit_code` / `.duration` sentinels and writes the same
`sweep_report.txt` / `.json` as a local sweep, then prints a ready
`sbatch --array=<failed ids> jobs/submit_sweep.sbatch` to rerun only the
failures.

Outputs land in the same `path2output/<run_name>/` layout as a local
sweep (see *Outputs* below). Bundled inputs (SPS, cooling tables,
`lib/default/`) resolve relative to the package, so the clone location
does not matter; only `path2output` follows the launch directory — set it
to an absolute path on a work/scratch filesystem for cluster runs.

## Outputs

### File layout

A single run writes these files into `path2output`:

```text
path2output/
├── dictionary.jsonl            # simulation state, one JSON object per snapshot
├── metadata.json               # run constants + termination + final-state blocks
└── trinity.log                 # log file (written when log_file = True)
```

A sweep writes those same files into one subdirectory per combination,
adds a fully-resolved `.param` sidecar to each, and writes two top-level
reports:

```text
outputs/my_sweep/
├── 1e5_sfe001_n1e3/
│   ├── 1e5_sfe001_n1e3.param   # full resolved params for this run
│   ├── dictionary.jsonl
│   ├── metadata.json
│   └── trinity.log
├── 1e5_sfe001_n1e4/
│   └── ...
├── sweep_report.txt            # human-readable sweep summary
└── sweep_report.json           # machine-readable sweep summary
```

### Auto-generated run names

Each sweep combination is named automatically:

```text
{mCloud}_sfe{sfe*100:03d}_n{nCore}[_density-profile][_PHII][_other-swept-keys]
```

The optional suffixes appear only when the relevant parameter is set
explicitly in the sweep file (not when left at its `default.param`
value):

- `_PL{alpha}` for `dens_profile = densPL` (e.g. `_PL0`, `_PL-2`), or
  `_BE{Omega}` for `densBE` (e.g. `_BE14`).
- `_yesPHII` / `_noPHII` when `include_PHII` is set — useful when
  sweeping the flag to compare runs with and without HII pressure.
- Any *other* swept parameter without a curated slot above gets a generic
  `_{key}{value}` suffix so distinct combinations never collapse onto the
  same folder. snake_case keys become camelCase and decimal points in
  floats become `p` (minus signs are kept, as in `_PL-2`). Examples:
  sweeping `ZCloud = [0.5, 1.0]` yields `_ZCloud0p5` / `_ZCloud1p0`;
  `coll_counter = [True, False]` yields `_collCounterTrue` /
  `_collCounterFalse`. Multiple generic suffixes are emitted in
  sorted-key order for stability.

  Folder-name safety rules applied to generic values:

  - **Hard-rejected** with an immediate `ValueError` (no sweep runs):
    values containing `/`, `\`, `..`, or any control character. This
    means **filepath-typed parameters cannot be swept** — set them once
    in your base param file. The check protects against silently nesting
    directories or escaping the sweep root.
  - **Sanitised** to `-`: any character outside `[A-Za-z0-9.+-]` (spaces,
    brackets, shell wildcards, unicode, `=`, `:` …). The sweep still runs
    but with a safe folder name.
  - **Length-capped** at 200 characters for the full run name; the sweep
    aborts with a clear error if you cross it (reserve room for sibling
    filenames within the 255-byte filesystem cap).

For example, `1e7_sfe010_n1e4_noPHII` is `mCloud=1e7, sfe=0.10,
nCore=1e4` with `include_PHII = False`.

The folder name is only a unique human-readable handle: every sweep run
also writes its full resolved parameter set to a per-run `.param` file
(plus the sweep-wide `sweep_report.json`), so a run with *no* suffix for
some key still has that key recorded — it just took the `default.param`
value. Master plot scripts that compare across sweeps should read
parameters from those sidecars rather than parse them out of the folder
name.

## Output data model

### dictionary.jsonl

Each simulation writes its full state to `dictionary.jsonl` as a stream
of newline-delimited JSON objects, one per snapshot. Writes are
append-only and crash-safe (the run flushes buffered snapshots on a clean
exit, `Ctrl+C`, or `SIGTERM`), so the file remains readable after a
crash — the last line may be partial but every prior line is a complete
snapshot. Snapshots are saved *before* each ODE step, so all values in
one snapshot share a single `t_now`.

Snapshot keys group into a handful of categories:

| Category | Example keys |
| --- | --- |
| Administrative | `model_name`, `current_phase`, `SimulationEndReason` |
| Cloud setup | `mCloud`, `mCluster`, `rCloud`, `nEdge` |
| Dynamical state | `t_now`, `R2`, `v2`, `Eb`, `T0`, `R1`, `Pb` |
| Feedback (SPS) | `Lmech_W`, `Lmech_SN`, `Qi`, `Lbol`, `pdot_total` |
| Pressures | `P_drive`, `P_HII`, `P_ram` |
| Forces | `F_grav`, `F_ram`, `F_ram_wind`, `F_ram_SN`, `F_HII`, `F_rad` |
| Bubble / shell profiles | `log_bubble_T_arr` + `bubble_T_arr_r_arr`, `bubble_v_arr` + `bubble_v_arr_r_arr`, `log_shell_n_arr` + `shell_r_arr` |

A handful of long 1-D profile arrays are downsampled before serialisation
to keep snapshots manageable. Each simplified array is paired with its
own abscissa (`*_r_arr`) and, where the values span many decades, stored
in $\log_{10}$ space (`log_*`). The target point budget is set by
`simplify_npoints` (see the
[Parameter Specifications](?view=docs&page=parameters)). To recover a
profile, linearly interpolate the paired abscissa against the (possibly
log-space) values.

The recommended way to read the file is the TRINITY reader API, which
hides the JSONL layout, the per-key unit metadata, and the legacy `.json`
format behind a small set of classes.

### metadata.json

Run-constant parameters and end-of-run summaries live in a sibling
`metadata.json` (current schema version 4) rather than being repeated in
every snapshot. The reader rehydrates the run constants into each
snapshot on load, so consumers never have to read this file directly —
but it is small and human-inspectable. Its top-level blocks are:

| Block | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| run constants | Every input parameter / set-once derived value that does not change after phase 0 (`mCloud`, `sfe`, `dens_profile`, physical constants, …). Membership is derived from the ParamSpec registry (see the [Parameter Specifications](?view=docs&page=parameters)), so it always matches the schema. |
| `termination` | `{exit_code, outcome, detail, timestamp, model_name}` — how the run ended. |
| `final_state` | Every scalar / bool / string on the state dict at run end, in internal units (pc, Myr, pc⁻³). Long arrays are excluded — their final values are the last line of `dictionary.jsonl`. |
| `termination_debug` | Last-two-snapshot diff, a NaN/Inf inventory, and physics sanity checks, for post-mortem debugging. |

All writes go through an atomic helper, so an interrupted write can never
leave a corrupt file.

### show_run

For a quick human-readable view of a finished run — run context,
termination reason, and final state — without writing any plotting code:

```bash
python -m trinity._output.show_run path2output/
```

It reads `metadata.json` and pretty-prints a curated subset; pass
`--json` for the full dump or `--quiet` for a scriptable exit code
(useful in batch loops over a sweep tree).

## Logging

The [Parameter Specifications](?view=docs&page=parameters) list the four
logging parameters (`log_level`, `log_console`, `log_file`, `log_colors`)
and their defaults. This section covers the conceptual ladder of log
levels.

Each level includes itself and all more severe levels:
`CRITICAL > ERROR > WARNING > INFO > DEBUG`. Setting `log_level = INFO`
emits `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages.

| Level | Typical messages | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEBUG` | Variable values, loop iterations, intermediate calculations, function entry/exit. | Development; debugging specific issues (default). |
| `INFO` | Phase transitions, major events (bubble burst, cloud edge reached), initialisation and completion markers. | Normal simulation runs. |
| `WARNING` | Values clamped to limits, fallback behaviour, unusual but non-critical conditions. | Production runs where only potential problems matter. |
| `ERROR` | Calculation failures, recoverable errors. | Silent runs where only actual errors matter. |
| `CRITICAL` | Unrecoverable failures, fatal errors. | When only simulation-stopping errors should print. |

With `log_level = INFO`, console output looks like:

```text
2026-01-08 15:30:00 | INFO     | trinity.main | === TRINITY Simulation Starting ===
2026-01-08 15:30:00 | INFO     | trinity.main | Model: test_simulation
2026-01-08 15:30:01 | INFO     | trinity.sps.read_sps | SPS data processed
2026-01-08 15:30:03 | INFO     | trinity.phase1_energy | Entering energy-driven phase
2026-01-08 15:30:45 | INFO     | trinity.main | === TRINITY Simulation Complete ===
```

## Troubleshooting

Most parameter errors are typos against the schema; the authoritative
list of valid keywords and defaults is the ParamSpec registry
(`trinity/_input/registry.py`), from which `trinity/_input/default.param`
is generated and mirrored in the
[Parameter Specifications](?view=docs&page=parameters). For issues and
